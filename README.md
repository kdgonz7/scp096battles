# SCP-096 Battles

## Description
Imagine you're relaxing at your computer when you accidentally catch a glimpse of SCP-096's face. Instead of attacking you outright, he shows up at your house and challenges you to a battle. Armed with your weapons, you accept the challenge and head to the arena.

In this gamemode, two players face off in an intense battle of survival and strategy. Players are divided into two teams: the SCP-096 Team and the NTF (Nine-Tailed Fox) Team. Each team has a single objective—eliminate the opposing team. 

When a player is defeated, the victorious team earns a point. These points can be spent on upgrades, enhancing their abilities and increasing their chances of victory. The gamemode is designed to be fast-paced and competitive, with more upgrades and features planned for future updates to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Prepare yourself for the ultimate showdown—will you absolutely maul your opponent as SCP-096, or will you outsmart and overpower your adversary as part of the NTF? The choice is yours!
